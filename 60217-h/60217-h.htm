The possibility of motoring through various sections of the Black Hills for
pleasure and business has long been known. The idea is new, however, of
selecting good automobile routes to reach the larger cities and points of
scenic interest in this region, and of platting the same as a guide to the stranger
who may be easily lost amid the windings and branchings of the roads in
forest, mining camp or city. The strenuous efforts of various localities and
counties along these routes to improve them during the last two years has made them now
such as may be travelled with pleasure.</p>

<p class='c008'>The natural scenery on a scale majestic in size, yet of readily appreciated magnitude; the
proximity of the primitive forest to the noise and rush of the mining or industrial center; the
strange thoughts on realizing that here lies the richest tract one hundred miles square on earth,
all serve to make the trip through the Black Hills a memorable one; even to him who has traveled
far and near across ocean, desert sands or broad plains in search of nature’s beauty spots.</p>

<p class='c008'>From a personal standpoint, the renewed vigor, and quieted nerves that result from
rest among such pleasant surroundings, breathing pure air, laden with the odor of the pines,
bathing in or drinking mineral waters all make it a trip well worth while.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is hoped that to the stranger to the Black Hills region this book will bring some
idea of the pleasure and profit to be found amid such surroundings, and that it will be an aid
to him in the proper enjoyment of the same.</p>

</div>

<div  class='c009'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><h2>CLIMATE</h2></div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>Moderate temperature, winter and summer, abundance of sunshine and clear, dry air make
the Black Hills particularly desirable from a tourist’s standpoint. The altitude ranging from
3500 to 8000 feet above sea level. Absolute freedom from mosquitoes in many parts of the
hills and cool, dry nights make it an ideal country for camping.</p>

<div  class='c009'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><h2>GAME</h2></div>

<p class='c010'>In the wilder portions, bears, wild cats, wolves, silver foxes, and other large game may be found.
Special provision has been made for re-stocking the Forest Reserve at frequent intervals with
deer and elk which, together with legal protection for these animals from December 1st to November
1st makes them very plentiful. Plover, partridges, pheasants, grouse, ducks and geese may be
easily had in season. Although many kinds of fish are found in the mountain streams, trout are the
most common. The streams are restocked at frequent intervals from the Government Fishery at Spearfish
with Brook, Locklaven, Speckled and Rainbow trout, so that fishing will continue to be one of the leading
diversions of the pleasure seeker. From November 1st to May 1st when trout fishing is prohibited in
South Dakota, the sport may be continued across the line in Wyoming where no such restriction exists.</p>

<div  class='c009'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><h2>SOUTH DAKOTA LAWS CONCERNING AUTOMOBILES</h2></div>

<p class='c010'>Residents of other states using their cars in South Dakota will not be
required to re-register their cars in South Dakota providing they have
complied with all laws regarding registration of automobiles in the state
from which they came, and providing such state extends a similar privilege to South Dakotans.</p>

<p class='c008'>Automobiles must be driven in a careful and prudent manner, at a rate of speed such as not to endanger
the property, life or limb of any person, provided that a rate of speed in excess of 25 miles per
hour is presumptive evidence of driving at a rate of speed which is not careful and prudent, in case of injury
to the person or property of another. Local authorities may limit speed to a rate of 10 miles per
hour provided proper notices or warnings are placed in the public highway indicating such limitation of
speed.</p>

<p class='c008'>The raising of the hand, by anyone who is leading, driving or riding a horse or other draft animal, as
a signal to stop shall cause the driver of any automobile thus signalled to, to stop his car until the danger
of frightening such animal is past.</p>

<div  class='c009'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><h2>DEADWOOD</h2></div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>Perhaps the best known city in the Northern Hills is Deadwood, the center of the industrial
and mining interests of this section. Most excellent hotel and garage accommodations, its
convenience to surrounding points of scenic interest, and a general spirit of genuine western
hospitality toward all will continue to make it a most popular tourist center. Although high in the
Hills it is connected with the plains outside by a good road of easy gradient.</p>

<div  class='c009'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><h2>RAPID CITY</h2></div>

<p class='c010'>At the point of entrance to the Black Hills from the east, Rapid City has become a leading
industrial and railway center. Good hotel and garage accommodations make this a pleasant
stopping place in the foothills. The trip westward into the Hills along Rapid Creek
to Pactola by auto, or by rail to Mystic, should not be overlooked by any tourist in this territory.</p>

<div  class='c009'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><h2>SPEARFISH</h2></div>

<p class='c010'>Spearfish is located on the northern margin of the Hills, close to the mouth of Spearfish canyon,
to Sand Creek, to Higgins Gulch, Crow Peak and other fishing and hunting resorts. It
has good hotel and garage accommodations, and is visited by thousands of tourists each year.</p>

<div  class='c009'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><h2>BELLE FOURCHE</h2></div>

<p class='c010'>Twenty-eight miles north of Deadwood and close to the 100,000 acre government irrigation
project is a thriving county seat town of 3000 population. It has been a
noted shipping point for those interested in cattle and sheep raising in years gone by
and is now becoming the principal center of business for the adjacent irrigated districts.</p>

<div  class='c009'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><h2>WHITEWOOD</h2></div>

<p class='c010'>A thriving village at the point of entrance into the Hills which will be remembered by
the tourist going by rail or auto to Deadwood, Lead, Spearfish or other points in the
northern Hills.</p>

<div  class='c009'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><h2>HILL CITY</h2></div>

<p class='c010'>This has been one of the leading towns in the heart of the Black Hills district since the
 early days of the Black Hills history. Numerous tin, mica and other mines and considerable
rich agricultural land are found near here. About 45 miles from Deadwood, Rapid
City and Hot Springs it is a convenient stopping place for tourists travelling through this territory.</p>

<div  class='c009'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><h2>THE HOMESTAKE MINE</h2></div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>The largest gold mine in the world, employing an average of 3500 men and producing
from $5,000,000 to $8,000,000 worth of gold bullion per year, has its principal
properties and mines at Lead.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Elliston Hoist, the largest now operated by the company, is 1850 feet deep. The 1200 H. P. hoisting
engine with its hoisting rope, a 7¾ inch by ⅝ inch flat laced steel cable weighing 7 pounds to the foot,
lifting a load of 10 tons, not including the weight of the cable from the bottom of the mine to the surface
in a few seconds, is an interesting sight. Nearby are two air compressors, one delivering air at 80 pounds
pressure for the use of rock drills and other machinery; the other compressing air to 850 pounds pressure
for use of compressed air haulage motors.</p>

<p class='c008'>Across the gulch the drill sharpening shop where 3000 drills are sharpened each day, and the foundry
and machine shop are points of interest. The noise of operation of the stamp mill night and day,
365 days in the year make its location easily determinable. Here 240 stamps each weighing 900 pounds
and dropping at the rate of 90 times per minute crush to a powder 1000 tons of ore each 24 hours. To
each ton of powdered rock is added 2400 gallons of water which wash it over the silver plated copper
plates. In another building it is re-ground, and the coarsest portion or sands sent to the Cyanide Plant.
Here solution is accomplished by the addition of potassium cyanide, and the gold then precipitated
by the addition of zinc dust. The finer portion of the powder or the slime is piped to the Slime Plant
at Deadwood, where the gold bearing powder is caught in filter presses and the gold then extracted as
before.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Homestake Pumping Plant at Hanna, 6 miles from Lead, and the Hydro-electric plant at Spearfish,
15 miles from Lead, furnish the water and power used in the Homestake properties. The Hydro-electric
Plant is the largest of its kind in the Hills. The water is carried in a tunnel 5 miles long from the
river in Spearfish Canyon, at a point 8 miles from Spearfish, to the reservoir on top of the ridge overlooking
and directly south of the city. The three surge towers, on the pipe lines leading from the reservoir
down the 700 foot drop to the power plant, may be seen for many miles.</p>

<div  class='c009'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><h2>SPEARFISH CANYON</h2></div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>There is probably no other scenic place in the Black Hills which has been given as much
attention by tourists, photographers, and magazine writers as Spearfish Canyon. The
Royal Gorge in Colorado, the Palisades of the Hudson and many other points of
national scenic wonder may be found reproduced here on a scale perhaps less grand, but making up in
beauty all that is lost in magnitude. Good automobile roads traverse long stretches of this canyon, entering
it from Deadwood, and from Spearfish as platted herein. It is anticipated that in a few years the road
will be made suitable for auto traffic the entire length of the canyon.</p>

<div  class='c009'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><h2>CRYSTAL CAVE</h2></div>

<p class='c010'>Crystal Cave, in the Northern Hills, is resplendent with stalactite and stalagmite formations
and is quite different in general structure from Wind Cave. During 1913 it
is expected that the construction of a new road from Deadwood will make this cave
accessible to automobile tourists.</p>

<div  class='c009'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><h2>SYLVAN LAKE THE NEEDLES HARNEY PEAK</h2></div>

<p class='c010'>One of the most interesting places in the Hills from a scenic point of view is located
about midway between Deadwood and Hot Springs. Harney Peak, the highest point
in the Hills from which can be seen four states, the hundreds of Needles, some rising
as much as 500 feet in cathedral tower like grandeur, the great varied vistas, and
the quiet beauty of Sylvan Lake surrounded by monstrous rock walls and pine clad heights, all bring to one
the realization of the real wonder and beauty of nature. Excellent hotel accommodations at Sylvan Lake
makes this region justly popular as a tourist resort.</p>

<div  class='c009'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><h2>SAND CREEK</h2></div>

<p class='c010'>This is a typical Black Hills stream in Wyoming close to Deadwood and Spearfish. The
fact that Wyoming laws allow trout fishing at all seasons of the year makes this stream
the rendezvous of the fisher both summer and winter.</p>

<div  class='c009'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><h2>WIND CAVE</h2></div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>One of the great sights of this region, in many respects excelling the famous Mammoth
Cave of Kentucky, is Wind Cave. Over 200 miles of passageway and many thousands of
rooms have been explored, some of these over 600 feet below the entrance. Yet, apparently
neither the bottom nor the sides of this cave have been reached. The great abundance of “frost
work” and “box work” in many forms make this cave unusually attractive and interesting. Guides will
take parties into the Cave each day at 9:00 A. M. and 2:00 P. M. and occasionally at other times.</p>

<div  class='c009'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><h2>HEALTH RESORTS</h2></div>

<p class='c010'>As a health resort the Southern Hills have gained a National reputation. A sanitarium
for treatment of tuberculosis patients has been established by the State near
Custer, 29 miles north of Hot Springs. At the latter city is the State Home for
Old Soldiers, and the Government Hospital for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers and Sailors. Also numerous
private sanitariums, for the treatment of various maladies, which are filled throughout the year.</p>

<div  class='c009'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><h2>HOT SPRINGS</h2></div>

<p class='c010'>The city gets its name from the hundred springs near there which give out large quantities
of water at a temperature of 98 degrees F. or warmer. The water from these and from
certain cold springs have been found to contain unusual mineral elements very valuable
in the treatment of rheumatism of all kinds, nervous complaints, indigestion and intestinal disorders,
pulmonary affections, diseases of the urinary organs, gout and skin diseases. Particularly noticeable have
been the curing of parties affected with rheumatism.</p>

<p class='c008'>Besides the small swimming pools at the various sanitariums, two immense pools have been constructed
which are centers of attraction during the summer months. These are the “Evans” and the “Mammoth
Springs Plunge,” both of which are enclosed in large buildings, and contain individual dressing rooms and
all other possible conveniences.</p>

<p class='c008'>One of the largest and finest equipped hotels in the state is located here.</p>

<div  class='c009'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><h2>EDGEMONT</h2></div>

<p class='c010'>Edgemont is a busy railway division point on the C. B. &amp; Q. Ry. It is located on the
Cheyenne River southwest of the Black Hills. To those who have seen the prairies of eastern
South Dakota, the Bad Land and Black Hills formations, a new type of topography is
presented extending to the south and west of Edgemont.</p>

<div  class='c009'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><h2>THE BAD LANDS</h2></div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>East of the Black Hills, and within easy reach, is scenery, somewhat mountainous in
nature, yet very different from anything in the Black Hills or in other mountainous
regions. To anyone who has not travelled the “Scenic Highway through South
Dakota,” a two days trip eastward from Rapid City over this road is well worth while.</p>

<p class='c008'>The tourist enters the Bad Lands near the town of Scenic, 45 miles east of Rapid City. From this
point the next 50 miles is in the midst of some of the strangest and most wonderful scenery known.
Broad grass covered basins are dotted with bare rounded hillocks or great irregular shaped buttes and
ridges. Along the northern border of this region and much of the time within sight of the road is “The
Great Wall” several hundred feet in height, appearing against the sky line to be a succession of domes,
towers, pinnacles and precipitous walls and gulches. The soil varies in color through the shades of white,
buff, yellow, red and green. The valleys and flat plateaus on the tops of the ridges or buttes are usually
grass covered while the slopes stand out most prominent because of their sheer height and nakedness. It
is a scene that cannot be properly described; strange and wonderful in the extreme. At first seemingly
grotesque, then strangely beautiful, impressions are left on the mind that will never be forgotten.</p>

<p class='c008'>Pictures and more detailed description of this region, also a complete guide of the road from Rapid
City eastward will be found in our “_Map and Guide of the Scenic Highway through South Dakota_.”</p>

<p class='c008'>No tourist should leave the Black Hills until this trip has been taken either by automobile or rail.
In either case he should go as far east as the towns of Interior or Kadoka, and actually go through
Cedar Pass which is five miles northeast of Interior.</p>

</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
Rapid City, the gateway to the Hills, lies on Rapid Creek for which it is
named, midway between its source in the Western Black Hills and its mouth,
where it empties into the Cheyenne river. Its location is ideal from the
standpoint of natural environment embracing, as it does, the rugged backbone
of the hills and a foreground of rolling prairie. In early days pioneers
were quick to see the natural advantages of the location for a town and their
selection proved the later choice of railroad engineers, who have made it the central point for
two great systems in western South Dakota. Four distinct lines radiate from Rapid City, viz:
The Omaha division of the Northwestern providing connection with Deadwood on the North
and the great South and Southeast. The Pierre division running to the state capital and Chicago.
The Milwaukee has its terminal here. It runs southeast through the Bad Lands,
the only railroad traversing this Wonderland of Nature, and on to Chicago. The Rapid
City, Black Hills &amp; Western has its headquarters in Rapid City, and is one of the most
wonderfully constructed railroads in the country. It follows Rapid Creek west to Mystic,
about thirty-five miles where it connects with the Burlington system. This is called the “Scenic”
route of the Hills and affords tourists one of the grandest of pictueresque views to be had
in the world. It is Colorado and the Grand Canyon in miniature.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>
<img src='images/i_013.jpg' alt='_Rapid River just West of Rapid City_' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>Located as it is in a country blessed by nature Rapid City provides more amusement to
lovers of the out door life than most cities. With a climate ofttimes as equitable in January
as that of Southern California and with rainfall usually confined to the spring months out of
door life finds here its perfect environment. The nights, owing to the altitude of nearly thirty-two
hundred feet, are always cool, there being few in the hottest of the summer months when
blankets are not needed. The absence of dew makes camping a delightful pastime and
there is trout fishing, for those who enjoy the gentle art of Isaac Walton, as good as the country
affords anywhere. Deer are plentiful in season and game birds, including grouse, partridge,
quail and duck, are plentiful enough to make it worth the while of any follower of
Nimrod.</p>

<p class='c008'>Rapid City itself being thus favorably located is the center of business activity radiating
east as far as the Missouri river and west, north and south to the boundaries of the Black
Hills. It has the three requisites of a progressive and up-to-date growing city—first-class
hotels, a new up-to-date theatre and a live newspaper. From the city all of the interesting
points in the Hills can be reached by railroads, or by automobiles over roads which are
being constantly improved.</p>

The Hotel Franklin is recognized as the finest hotel in the state and is the
headquarters for tourists. Deadwood is in the heart of the pictueresque “Playgrounds
of South Dakota”, where fishing, hunting, camping and fine automobile
roads through the pine clad Hills and Canyons form a part of the attractions that
make it the Mecca of Tourists. Mosquitos and heat are unknown. The hub of all points of
interest in the Hills is Deadwood. The famous Homestake, the largest gold mine in the
world, and Crystal Cave, the great underground cavern that extends for miles are reached
from Deadwood.</p>

  <h2 class='c011'>HILL CITY, SOUTH DAKOTA</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>Hill City is situated on the Burlington Railroad,
and is right in the midst of the mining
district of the Southern Black Hills, it is
surrounded by fine mountain ranches, that
have suffered only one crop failure in 25 years.
These ranches produce 60 to 70 bushels of oats
per acre that weigh from 40 to 48 lbs. to the
bushel, wild and timothy hay grow abundantly, as
well as potatoes, all without irrigation.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hill City being the half way point on the
Scenic Highway north and south through the Hills
makes it the ideal point for a noon or night stop
for automobilists, there being first-class hotels and
restaurants to provide comfort and good meals
for the tourists. By the opening of the season of
1913 the town will be equipped with a garage at
which can be had gas, oil and minor repairs.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>The City of Belle Fourche, the County
Seat of Butte County, is located in the
Belle Fourche Valley upon the Belle
Fourche and Redwater rivers. The city was

from the ranges of Montana and Wyoming
as well as the fertile valleys of South Dakota.
It is surrounded by beautiful valleys
which extend to the foot of the Bear Lodge
and Black Hills. From the first cattle town
in the state it has grown to be one of the
first cities of the state. Its citizenship is progressive
and its business men are working
for the best interests of the community. It
has one of the best hotels in the state and its
public buildings would be a credit to a much
larger community. It is the gateway to the
Belle Fourche and Spearfish valleys. The
diversion dam of the Belle Fourche Irrigation
Project is almost within the city limits.
This dam diverts the water from the Belle
Fourche river into the great reservoir covering
over 8000 acres of land and holding
over 200,000 acre feet of water. This water
is held by the largest earth dam in existence,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>being in height 115 feet and over 6000 feet
in length and retaining sufficient water to
irrigate 100,000 acres of land. This dam is
one of the marvels of the age. It is worth
one’s time to visit the same. The Spearfish
valley is older in irrigation and has an abundance
of fruit. Within six miles of Belle
Fourche is the largest natural water power
plant in the northwest, where the power for
the great Homestake mine is generated from
the waters of the Redwater river. A beautiful
highway logged herein connects Belle
Fourche with all the valleys and the famous
trout fishing streams of South Dakota as
well as the picturesque Sand Creek of Wyoming.
In order to reach these streams in
the most acceptable manner take the logged
highways from Belle Fourche.</p>

Edgemont, is situated on the Burlington Railroad, a divisional point,
and the terminal of the Black Hills branch of the celebrated C. B. &amp;
Q. system.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is the deep well town of the United States, having one well
flowing 400,000 gallons of hot water every day, with a pressure of
90 pounds at a depth of 2988 feet and another well in course of construction now
2835 feet deep.</p>

<p class='c008'>To the north of the town lie the celebrated Black Hills, the Forest Reserve, and
a few miles away is the great Wind Cave, and government park, soon to be stocked
with buffalo and elk.</p>

<p class='c008'>East, south and west of the city lie great belts of rich agricultural lands now in
course of development. A short distance from the town is the government Experimental
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>farm, where all kinds of seed and methods of cultivation are tried out for
the benefit of settlers. Government land can be secured within a few miles of the
city. The city has four churches, seventy businesses represented, one of the finest
school buildings in the state, with a competent corps of teachers, a large garage, 50
by 120 feet, containing all the latest machinery for repairing autos, including the
new autogenous welding machine, an immense bridge over the Cheyenne river, admitting
of travel the year around.</p>

<p class='c008'>Twenty trains leave Edgemont every day, among which are six passenger trains—four
of them trans-continental, fully equipped with all conveniences for the traveling
public.</p>

<p class='c008'>The finest melons grown in any country are produced here and are in competition
with the Rockey Ford product of Colorado.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Fall River County Fair Association has its headquarters in the city, possessing
one of the best race tracks in the state. Several thousand dollars will be expended
upon this proposition the present year for the accommodation of exhibitors.</p>

<p class='c008'>For business locations and pleasure, Edgemont has few equals. The town is
the official gateway to the Black Hills for the Denver to Deadwood auto road.</p>
